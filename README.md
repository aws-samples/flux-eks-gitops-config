# Managing configuration of Amazon EKS clusters per environment with GitOps using Flux

This repository provides a sample configuration blueprint for configuring multiple Amazon EKS clusters (`test` and `production`) using [GitOps](https://www.gitops.tech/) with [Flux v2](https://fluxcd.io/docs/). This repository installs a set of commonly used Kuberntes add-ons to perform policy enforcement, restrict network traffic with network policies, cluster monitoring, extend Kubernetes deployment capabilities enabling Canary deployments for your applications... 

This repository defines a baseline cluster configuration and customizes it for a `test` and `production` clusters leveraging [Kustomize overlays](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/kustomization/#bases-and-overlays). Aside of the cluster add-ons and configuration, it also installs [podinfo](https://github.com/stefanprodan/podinfo) as sample application.

This sample uses a repository per team structure to centrally manage multiple Kubernetes clusters belonging to different environments while enabling soft-multitenancy, giving autonomy to the tenants to define what gets deployed on their namespaces. In this structure, this repository is owned by a central plaftform team that configures the cluster add-ons and on-boards tenants creating dedicated namespaces for them and creating the *GitRepository* object pointing to the tenant repository where *Kustomization* and Deployment manifests (or *HelmRelease* CRDs) are defined. Flux impersonates a *ServiceAccount* on the tenant namespace to sync Kubernetes manifests from the repository. By default, this ServiceAccount has a RoleBinding in the namespace to `cluster-admin` *ClusterRole*. You may want to further constraint the ServiceAccount permissions to limit the resources a tenant can create. You can find more information on the [Controller permissions](https://fluxcd.io/docs/security/#controller-permissions) documentation. You may also consider locking down Flux to deny cross-namespace access to Flux custom resources and configuring a default service account for *Kustomizations* and *HelmReleases*. You'll find more information about multi-tenancy lockdown [here](https://fluxcd.io/docs/installation/#multi-tenancy-lockdown).

You can read more about ways to structure GitOps repositories on the Flux documentation [here](https://fluxcd.io/docs/guides/repository-structure/#repo-per-team). 

You can use this sample repository to experiment with the predefined cluster configuration and use it as a baseline to adjust it to your own needs.

This sample installs the following Kubernetes add-ons:

* **[metrics-server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server):** Aggregator of resource usage data in your cluster, commonly used by other Kubernetes add ons, such us [Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.html) or [Kubernetes Dashboard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/dashboard-tutorial.html).
* **[Calico](https://docs.projectcalico.org/about/about-calico):** Project Calico is a network policy engine for Kubernetes. Calico network policy enforcement allows you to implement network segmentation and tenant isolation. For more information check the [Amazon EKS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/calico.html).
* **[Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/):** Kubernetes Policy Management Engine. Kyverno allows cluster administrators to manage environment specific configurations independently of workload configurations and enforce configuration best practices for their clusters. Kyverno can be used to scan existing workloads for best practices, or can be used to enforce best practices by blocking or mutating API requests.
* **[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/):** Defacto standard open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit for Kubernetes. This repository installs [kube-prometheus-stack](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack).
* **[Flagger](https://flagger.app/):** Progressive delivery operator for Flux. Flagger can run automated application analysis, testing, promotion and rollback for the following deployment strategies: Canary, A/B Testing and Blue/Green. For more details, check the [Flagger documentation](https://docs.flagger.app/).
* **[nginx-ingress-controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/):** Ingress controller to expose apps and enable [canary deployments and A/B testing with Flagger](https://docs.flagger.app/tutorials/nginx-progressive-delivery).

**NOTE:** The add-ons in this repository are not configured for a production-ready cluster (e.g. Prometheus would need to be configured for long term metric storage, nginx would need HPA and any custom settings you need...).

To understand how this repository is structured and get more detail on the configurations, go to the [repository structure](docs/repository-structure.md) docs. If you are not familiar with Flux, it's recommended to read through its [documentation](https://fluxcd.io/docs/) before getting started.

### Credits 

This repository is inspired by the following two repository examples provided by Flux:

* [flux2-kustomize-helm-example](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2-kustomize-helm-example/)
* [flux2-multi-tenancy](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2-multi-tenancy)

It also leverages sample cluster policies created by Kyverno:

* [Kyverno Policies](https://kyverno.io/policies/)

## Deploy this sample

### Prerequisites

The add-ons and configurations of this repository require Kubernetes 1.21 or higher (this is required by the version of kube-prometheus-stack that is installed, you can use 1.19+ installing previous versions of kube-prometheus-stack). This example assumes you'll bootstrap Flux on an Amazon EKS cluster that doesn't have installed any of the add-ons above. It also assumes that the cluster has already installed the following add-ons:

* [AWS Load Balancer Controller](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/aws-load-balancer-controller.html)

The reason why the above add-ons aren't handled by Flux is because they need IAM Roles to be created in advance.

To create an EKS cluster with `eksctl` follow the instructions in ![docs/deploy-eks-cluster](/docs/deploy_cluster.md).

You can also leverage [aws-eks-accelerator-for-terraform](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-eks-accelerator-for-terraform) to deploy a "batteries included" EKS cluster according to best practices and recommendations. Follow instructions in [eks-cluster-with-new-vpc](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-eks-accelerator-for-terraform/tree/main/deploy/eks-cluster-with-new-vpc).

**IMPORTANT NOTE (if you use an existing cluster):** This sample installs multiple Kubernetes add-ons and their respective [Kubernetes Custom Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) via Helm. Currently, Helm [doesn't support deleting CRDs](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/custom_resource_definitions/#some-caveats-and-explanations), so they'll need to be deleted manually. Also, even after deleting the resources, there can still be calico `iptables` rules on the nodes that might interfere in unexpected ways with networking in your cluster and you will need to recycle all your nodes (more information [here](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/blob/master/hack/remove-calico-policy/remove-policy.md)). It's recommended to create a dedicated Amazon EKS cluster to deploy this sample.

You will also need the following:

* Install flux CLI on your computer following the instructions [here](https://fluxcd.io/docs/installation/). This repository has been tested with flux 0.22.
* A GitHub account and a [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) that can create repositories.

### Bootstrap your cluster

Fork this repository on your personal GitHub account and export your GitHub access token, username and repo name:

```bash
  export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your-token>
  export GITHUB_USER=<your-username>
  export GITHUB_REPO=<repository-name>
```

Define whether you want to bootstrap your cluster with the `TEST` or the `PRODUCTION` configuration:

```bash
  # TEST configuration
  export CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT=test

  # PRODUCTION configuration
  export CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

Verify that your stagging cluster satisfies the prerequisites with:

```bash
  flux check --pre
```

You can now bootstrap your cluster with Flux CLI.

```bash
  flux bootstrap github --owner=${GITHUB_USER} --repository=${GITHUB_REPO} --branch=main --path=clusters/${CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT} --personal
```

The bootstrap command commits the manifests for the Flux components in `clusters/${CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT}/flux-system` directory and creates a deploy key with read-only access on GitHub, so it can pull changes inside the cluster.

Confirm that Flux has finished applying the configuration to your cluster (it will take 3 or 4 minutes to sync everything):

```bash
  $ flux get kustomization
  NAME                READY MESSAGE                                                           REVISION                                        SUSPENDED

```

Get the URL for the nginx ingress controller that has been deployed in your cluster (you will see two ingresses, since Flagger will create a canary ingress):

```bash
   $ kubectl get ingress -n podinfo
   NAME             CLASS   HOSTS          ADDRESS                               PORTS   AGE
   podinfo          nginx   podinfo.test   k8s-xxxxxx.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com   80      23h
   podinfo-canary   nginx   podinfo.test   k8s-xxxxxx.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com   80      23h
```

Confirm that podinfo can be correctly accessed via ingress:

```bash
  $ curl -H "Host: podinfo.test" k8s-xxxxxx.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
  {
  "hostname": "podinfo-primary-65584c8f4f-d7v4t",
  "version": "6.0.0",
  "revision": "",
  "color": "#34577c",
  "logo": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stefanprodan/podinfo/gh-pages/cuddle_clap.gif",
  "message": "greetings from podinfo v6.0.0",
  "goos": "linux",
  "goarch": "amd64",
  "runtime": "go1.16.5",
  "num_goroutine": "10",
  "num_cpu": "2"
  }
```

Congratulations! Your cluster has sync'ed all the configuration defined on the repository. Continue exploring the configuration following these docs:

* [Review the repository structure to understand the applied configuration](docs/repository-structure.md)
* [Test the cluster policies configured with Kyverno](docs/test-kyverno-policies.md)
* [Test Canary deployments with Flux, Flagger and nginx controller](docs/flagger-canary-deployments.md)

# Clean up

If you created the cluster using eksctl, you can simply run the following command and eksctl will delete the cluster and all its resources.

```bash
eksctl delete cluster -f docs/examples/cluster.yaml
```

If you just want to remove the resources and keep the cluster, proceed with the following steps:

1. Delete the following files from your git repository and commit the changes:
    * `clusters/${CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT}/apps.yaml`
    * `clusters/${CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT}/config.yaml`
    * `clusters/${CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT}/infrastructure.yaml`

1. Wait until Flux syncronizes the changes and starts deleting the resources (you should see no Kustomizations and no HelmReleases in your cluster). You can use the following command to check whether there're any pending Kustomizations and HelmReleases in your cluster:

    ```bash
    flux get kustomization
    flux get helmrelease -A
    ```

1. Now, run the following command to uninstall Flux. This will remove the Flux controllers from your cluster.

    ```bash
    flux uninstall
    ```

    You'll need to confirm deletion with 'y'. You'll see a similar output to the one below:

    ```
