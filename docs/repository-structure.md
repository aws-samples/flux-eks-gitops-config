# Repository structure

The configuration of Kubernetes clusters in this repository is structured in the following folders:

## clusters

Contains the [Kustomization](https://fluxcd.io/docs/components/kustomize/kustomization/) objects to sync with each cluster (`test` and `production`). The repository leverages [Kustomize overlays](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/kustomization/#bases-and-overlays) to apply different security and application settings for `TEST` and `PRODUCTION` clusters.

## infrastructure

Contains the add-ons to be installed on the cluster as well as the [source](https://fluxcd.io/docs/components/source/) objects for the add-ons and applications installed. It's divided into two subfolders:

* **sources:** contains all the [GitRepository](https://fluxcd.io/docs/components/source/gitrepositories/) and [HelmRepository](https://fluxcd.io/docs/components/source/helmrepositories/) objects for the add-ons that will be installed.
* **add-ons:** contains the Kustomization, [HelmRelease](https://fluxcd.io/docs/components/helm/helmreleases/) and other manifests to install and configure the add-ons listed on the README.  

## config

The `config/base/policies` folder contains a set of Kyverno policies implementing a common set of security best practices. Then, there are kustomize overlays for `test` and `production` to configure Kyverno in `audit` or `enforce` mode.

These policies are meant to be used as an example and a starting point to define your own policies. This is not meant to be a comprehensive implementation of security best practices. To learn about EKS Security Best practices recommendations, please visit the EKS Best Practices guides [here](https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/security/docs/).

## tenants

Containts the tenants that are on-boarded to the cluster. The example contains a single tenant named `podinfo-team` and creates the following resources:
* A namespace for the team
* A ServiceAccount within the namespace with a *RoleBinding* to *ClusterRole* `cluster-admin` for Flux to impersonate when reconciling tenant resources. You can further constrain permissions to limit the resources that tenants can create.
* A *GitRepository* Custom Resource pointing to the tenant repository: [flux-eks-gitops-config-tenant](https://github.com/aws-samples/flux-eks-gitops-config-tenant)
* A [Kustomization](https://fluxcd.io/docs/components/kustomize/kustomization/) Custom Resource pointing to the above repository to reconcile tenant resources. 

Kustomize overlays are used to patch `test` and `production` deployments with specific values.

## tenant repository [flux-eks-gitops-config-tenant](https://github.com/aws-samples/flux-eks-gitops-config-tenant)

Contains the tenant applications to be deployed on the cluster. This sample uses [podinfo](https://github.com/stefanprodan/podinfo) as example application and uses Kustomize overlays to set up spefic configuration to `TEST` and `PRODUCTION` clusters.

The application is configured to use progressive deployments orchestrated by Flagger and nginx ingress controller. [ServiceMonitors](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/main/Documentation/api.md#servicemonitor) are also configured for the Prometheus Operator to scrape application metrics and a [MetricTemplate](https://docs.flagger.app/usage/metrics#custom-metrics) to define the Canary metric to be used for our deployments. These objects are defined in `apps/base/podinfo/canary.yaml`.

```

To test progressive deployments of podinfo go to [Flagger Canary Deployments](flagger-canary-deployments.md).

# Object Dependencies

The repository specifies dependencies between FluxCD Kustomization and HelmRelease objects as follows:

## Kustomizations

Flux starts sync'ing the infrastructure Kustomization. Once it's sync'ed and passes [health checks](https://fluxcd.io/docs/components/kustomize/kustomization/#health-assessment), it will sync the config Kustomization and finally the apps kustomization.  

```
infrastructure
      |-- config
            |-- tenants
```

## Â HelmReleases

Within the infrastructure Kustomization, this repo defines the following dependencies between HelmReleases:

```
[ calico | kube-prometheus-stack | metrics-server ]
                     |-------- [ kyverno | ingress-nginx ]
                                         |-------- [ flagger ]
```
