#  Testing canary deployments with Flagger and nginx ingress controller

Once the cluster add-ons have been deployed and configured, the development team `podinfo-team` can deploy the podinfo application as well as leverage Flagger to perform canary deployments of the application. All the podinfo application resources are defined on the [flux-eks-gitops-config-tenant](https://github.com/aws-samples/flux-eks-gitops-config-tenant) repository. 

First, create an [Alias record](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/route-53-create-alias-records/) (if using Route 53) or a CNAME in your public DNS zone pointing to the nginx ingress Load Balancer URL (you could also leverage [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) to manage Ingress DNS registration). To get the ingress URL, run the following command:

```bash
   $ kubectl get ingress -n podinfo
   NAME             CLASS   HOSTS          ADDRESS                               PORTS   AGE
   podinfo          nginx   podinfo.test   k8s-xxxxxx.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com   80      23h
   podinfo-canary   nginx   podinfo.test   k8s-xxxxxx.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com   80      23h
```

Then, on your fork of `flux-eks-gitops-config-tenant` repository, update the *Ingress* and *Canary* configuration to use your domain name. This way, you can easily access the podinfo application on your browser.

If you don't have a public DNS zone, instead of the above, you can create an entry on your local /etc/hosts file for `podinfo.test` (or podinfo.production, depending of your cluster environment) pointing to the IPs of your Load Balancer, so you can easily access podinfo via browser in your PC. If this is your case, skip step 1.

1. `${CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT}/podinfo-values.yaml`: substitute the value of host that's currently `podinfo.${CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT}` with the domain name you have created (in the example below `myapp.mydomain.com`).

```yaml
  apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
  kind: HelmRelease
  metadata:
    name: podinfo
    namespace: podinfo
  spec:
    chart:
      spec:
        version: "6.0.0"
    test:
      enable: false
    values:
      replicaCount: 2
      ui:
        color: "#34577c"
      ingress:
        hosts:
          - host: "myapp.mydomain.com"
            paths:
              - path: /
                pathType: ImplementationSpecific
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: "256m"
          memory: "128Mi"
```

1. `{$CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT}/podinfo-values.yaml`: substitute the URL on line 69 that flagger will use to perform load tests on the application:

If you have created a custom domain name, it should look like the following:

```yaml
  cmd: "hey -z 1m -q 10 -c 2 http://myapp.mydomain.com"
```

If you have not created a custom domain name, update the URL with your ingress URL

```yaml
  cmd: "hey -z 1m -q 10 -c 2 -host podinfo.test http://k8s-xxxxx.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com"
```

Commit and push your changes to the repository and confirm Flux has synchronized them on your cluster. You can do that by running:

```bash
flux get kustomizations podinfo-team -n podinfo
```

Make sure that the output includes the latest <COMMIT-ID> from your repository:

```
NAME           READY   MESSAGE                                                REVISION                        SUSPENDED
podinfo-team   True    Applied revision: main/<COMMIT-ID>                     main/<COMMIT-ID>                False
```

If needed, you can force reconciliation with the following command:

```bash
  $ flux reconcile kustomization podinfo-team -n podinfo
  ► annotating Kustomization podinfo-team in podinfo namespace
  ✔ Kustomization annotated
  ◎ waiting for Kustomization reconciliation
  ✔ Kustomization reconciliation completed
  ✔ applied revision main/b7d10ca21be7cac0dcdd14c80353012ccfedd4fe
```

Access podinfo in your browser either with your custom DNS name or with podinfo.test / podinfo.production.

Now, let's change the background color of the podinfo app. Edit `${CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT}/podinfo-values.yaml` and change the `color` value (for example, red: #ff0000). You can use [this](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp) HTML color picker):

```yaml
  apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
  kind: HelmRelease
  metadata:
    name: podinfo
    namespace: podinfo
  spec:
    chart:
      spec:
        version: "6.0.0"
    test:
      enable: false
    values:
      replicaCount: 2
      ui:
        color: "#ff0000"
      ingress:
        hosts:
          - host: "myapp.mydomain.com"
            paths:
              - path: /
                pathType: ImplementationSpecific
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: "256m"
          memory: "128Mi"
```

Commit the change to your repository and watch Flux applying the change and Flagger rolling it out. You can instantly reconcile changes on your cluster with the following command:

```bash
  $ flux reconcile kustomization podinfo-team -n podinfo
  ► annotating Kustomization podinfo-team in podinfo namespace
  ✔ Kustomization annotated
  ◎ waiting for Kustomization reconciliation
  ✔ Kustomization reconciliation completed
  ✔ applied revision main/b7d10ca21be7cac0dcdd14c80353012ccfedd4fe
```

Now, watch the Flagger canary testing and rollout with the following command:

```bash
  $ kubectl describe canary podinfo-canary -n podinfo
  Name:         podinfo-canary
  Namespace:    podinfo
